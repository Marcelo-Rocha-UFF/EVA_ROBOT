# EVA Audio Module #

The EVA Audio Module is responsible for playing all audio files used in the interaction script, whether they are music files, sound effects or speech audio files generated by the *IBM-Watson* service. The module can play files in *wav* and *mp3* formats. Despite the various library options available for Python, one option that seemed most interesting was the play command that is available in the system after installing the **sox** package. The play command can play audio files in different formats using the following syntax:
```
> play <audio_file>
```
The **sox** package can be easily installed with the following command:
```
sudo apt-get install sox
sudo apt-get install sox libsox-fmt-all
```
For an audio file (music or sound effects) to be used in an interaction script, this file must be in the **Audio Files** folder, which is located within the Audio Module, on *Raspberry*. When the robot needs to play the audio of the speeches generated by *Watson*, the Audio Module will look for these files in the **TTS Cache Files** folder located inside the Audio Module. **Figure 1** shows the Audio Module and the folders that store the audio files.
