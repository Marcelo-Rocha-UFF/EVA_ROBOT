# Speech-To-Text Module #

This module is responsible for transforming the voice audio, captured by *Matrix Voice*, into text (string). For this, Google's Speech-To-Text (STT) cloud service is used. The Python library used for voice capture (**speech_recognition**) allows the use of other STT services, in addition to the Google API. You can see the library documentation in https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/.
