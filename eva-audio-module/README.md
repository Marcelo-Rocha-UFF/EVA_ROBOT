# Audio Module #

This module is responsible for playing all types of audio files. It is responsible for playing the audio of the speeches generated by the *IBM-Watson* TTS service as well as music files and sound effects. Speech files are stored in the local **TTS Cache Files** folder and music and effects audio files are stored locally in the **Audio Files** folder.

Instead of using a library to play the audios, an option that seemed more interesting was using the *play* command that is available in the **sox** package. The *play* command can play audio files in different formats (**wav**, **mp3**, **etc**.) using the following syntax: **play <*audio_file*>**. The **sox** package can be easily installed with the following command:

`
sudo apt-get install sox
`

`
sudo apt-get install sox libsox-fmt-all
`
